- [ ] Inside this function, send a `POST` request to the `api/places` api endpoint with the new place data in the body
- [ ] Expand the api endpoint to handle `POST` requests
- [ ] With the received data, create a new place document in the mongoDB
- [ ] In the handleSubmit function, reroute the user to the main page after a successful `POST` request
